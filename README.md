Introductions:

I was creating a working app for employers to fill out a new employee from through prompts with node app.js. Along with creating the class for the general employee information with each for engineer, intern and manager. When the data is imputed for the employee's data will be render with hmtlRender.js that will then completed with specific roles for the employee's hmtl files. Than will be return through the app.js a new whole team html, with different cards assigned to the specific roles.
